## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Javascript

### What I learned

I found this challenge very interesting, especially from the **Javascript** side, because it wasn't very easy to complete the various features requested, but overall it was excellent training. I have certainly learned to better master similar situations, such as the management of inputs in relation to the dynamic updating of the three **counters**.

### Continued development

Challenges like this give you the opportunity to measure yourself every time in a different piece of the vast world of interactivity via **JS** so.. let's continue like this ;)
